<h3 class="t">   Filling : </h3>
_ 1 (3.9-ounce) package chocolate instant pudding and pie filling
_ 2 1/2 cups heavy cream
<h3 class="t">  Frosting : </h3> 
_ 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips      
_ 3/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces

<h3 class="t">  Step 1 </h3> 
Gather all ingredients.
<img class="steps" src="picture/8762039-Blackout-cake-ddmfs-3271-4x3-step01-56a9b4fbcfef4dbb9a9d4b8410855250.webp" alt="">
<h3 class="t">  Step 2 </h3>
For the cake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Coat 3 (9-inch) round cake pans with cooking spray; line bottoms 
of each cake pan with parchment paper,
and spray parchment lightly with cooking spray. Set aside.
<h3 class="t">  Step 3 </h3>
Whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder,baking soda, 
and salt together in a large bowl until no lumps remain.
<h3 class="t">  Step 4 </h3>
Combine buttermilk, canola oil, eggs, and vanilla in the bowl of
a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat on medium-low 
speed until combined,about 30 seconds. Reduce speed to low, 
and gradually beat in flour mixture until just combined
, 1 to 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed. 
With mixer on low speed,slowly stream in hot coffee, 
beating until just incorporated, about 1 minute. 
Divide batter evenly among the prepared cake pans,
about 2 cups each.

<h3 class="t">  Step 5 </h3>
Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden pick 
inserted in the center comes out with a few moist 
crumbs,about 18 minutes. Let cakes cool completely 
in cake pans on a wire rack, about 45 minutes.
<img class="steps" src="picture/8762039-Blackout-cake-ddmfs-3261-4x3-step041-ebd0f73a2018466ca7a44bd1b2ea364e.webp" alt="">
<h3 class="t">  Step 6 </h3>
While cake cools, prepare filling: Whisk together 
pudding mix and heavy cream until mostly smooth and
slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Chill, covered,
until fully set, about 30 minutes.

<h3 class="t">  Step 7 </h3>
Meanwhile, prepare frosting: Microwave chocolate chips,
butter, and heavy cream in a large microwave-safe bowl 
on High in 30-second intervals, stirring thoroughly
between intervals, until smooth and melted, 
about 1 minute 30 seconds to 2 minutes.
Chill, covered, until partially set but spreadable,
25 to 30 minutes.
<h3 class="t">  Step 8 </h3>
To assemble, remove cooled cakes from cake pans, 
and discard parchment paper. Slightly trim tops 
of each cake layer to create a flat surface,
and transfer trimmings to a large bowl.
Using your hands, break up cake trimmings into
fine crumbs, and set them aside (you should have
at least 1 1/2 cups crumbs). Place 1 trimmed cake
layer, top side up, on a plate or cake stand.
<h3 class="t">  Step 9 </h3>
Remove set filling from the refrigerator,
and whisk lightly until completely smooth
and slightly loosened. Top cake layer with half
(about 1 1/2 cups) of filling; spread to edges
of cake in an even layer using an offset spatula.
Top with second cake layer, top side down,
and repeat the process with remaining filling.
Top with third cake layer, top side down.

<h3 class="t">  Step 10 </h3>
Stir chilled frosting until smooth.
Using a large offset spatula,
spread frosting evenly over the top
and sides of the cake

<h3 class="t">  Step 11 </h3>
Gently press reserved cake crumbs evenly 
over into frosting, covering the top and
 sides completely. Discard any remaining crumbs.
Slice and serve!
